<h3 style="background-color: #D0A577;">Feeding</h3>
<p>
    <b>Feed your dog a high quality dog food</b>. Read the label of a prospective food. The first couple ingredients should be some kind of meat, not meat by-product or a grain. 
    This will help you know that the food is high in good protein, not just filler.
    It is recommended that you feed your dog twice a day;   he first half in the morning and the second half in the evening.
</p>
   <h3 style="background-color: #D0A577;">Vaccination</h3>
   <p> <b>Get your dog vaccinated. </b>Your veterinarian will advise you as to which diseases are common in the area and so which diseases it is necessary to vaccinate against.
     Typically, vaccinations are kept up to date with regular booster injections, which may either be yearly or three-yearly, depending on the disease. </p>
     
    <h3 style="background-color: #D0A577;">Health measures</h3>
    <p> <b>Use regular parasite preventative treatments. </b>It important to treat regularly with basic worming against roundworms. 
        Exactly how often depends on your pet's lifestyle. 
        An indoor dog is at lower risk than a hunting dog of picking up worms, and this will influence your vet's advice about how often to deworm. 
        A low risk dog may only need a round worming treatment two or three times a year, whereas a high risk dog may need monthly treatments.</p>
    <h3 style="background-color: #D0A577;">Grooming and showering</h3>
    <p> <b>Keep your dog's coat clean. </b>Dirty coats can lead to secondary skin infections, so be prepared to bathe your dog with a mild dog shampoo if it gets really dirty. 
        Most dogs don't need baths more than once every month or so, but this varies widely depending on breed and activities.</p>
